                <h3>The Beginning at CERN</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP was first introduced in 1989, by Tim Berners-Lee and a team of other colleagues at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN). They proposed to enhance data transfer of documents between scientists and other staff who were scattered across the globe. This solution would eventually become accessible to the public, providing a robust and scalable framework for data communication across a vast series of networks. In addition to data communication, HTTP laid the groundwork for standardizing and setting policy for HTML document, image, and multimedia file retrieval and delivery.

                <h3>The First Version: HTTP/0.9</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP/0.9 was the first version of HTTP and was a simple framework, with only one command (GET). The GET command allowed users to send requests for HTML documents from various servers and these documents only consisted of plain text responses. The initial version of HTTP (deployed at CERN) proved that the concept could work in numerous real-world environments and eventually evolved into a client-server model.

                <h3>A Major Leap Forward: HTTP/1.1</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1997, HTTP/1.1 was released to address multiple web performance issues and catapulted the growth of the internet. One of the key improvements introduced by HTTP/1.1 was the addition of persistent connections or “keep alive” connections which allowed a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to be utilized for many HTTP requests and responses at once. Keep alive connections reduced the number of resources necessary to load elements, leading to quicker data processing and webpage loading speeds. Another key improvement implemented with HTTP/1.1 was the inclusion of host headers. Host headers enabled websites to be loaded a single IP address, enhancing web scalability. HTTP/1.1 was the standard for nearly 20 years and shaped the web into what we know it as today.
