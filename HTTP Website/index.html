                <p>HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundational layer for data communication across the World Wide Web. It utilizes a client-server model, where HTTP serves as a conduit for sending client data requests, to a server that stores and relays the requested data; the client can access data by entering a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into a web browser.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Client</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A client is a computer or software application that requests services or resources from a server. In the context of HTTP, a client is typically a web browser that sends requests to a web server to retrieve web pages and other resources.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Server</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A server is a computer or software application that provides services or resources to clients. In the context of HTTP, a server is typically a web server that responds to requests from clients by delivering web pages and other resources.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A URL is a standardized way of identifying and locating resources on the internet. It consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., http or https), the domain name (e.g., www.example.com), and the path to the specific resource (e.g., /index.html).</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Stateless Protocol</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A stateless protocol is a communication protocol that does not retain any information about previous requests or interactions. Each request is treated as an independent transaction, without any knowledge of prior requests. This means that each request must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>HTTP Secure (HTTPS)</strong>
                    <dd>A mitigation for security risks where Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is used to keep data secure in the communication channel between the client and the server.</dd>

                <h2>History of HTTP</h2>
                <p>HTTP was first introduced in 1989, by Tim Berners-Lee and a team of other colleagues at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN). They proposed to enhance data transfer of documents between scientists and other staff who were scattered across the globe. This solution would eventually become accessible to the public, providing a robust and scalable framework for data communication across a vast series of networks.</p>

                <h2>Development of HTTP</h2>
                <p>Over the past few decades, HTTP has undergone several updates to improve efficiency and in most recent years, has incorporated security upgrades. </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Future of HTTP</h2>
                <p>Over the next few years, it is expected that HTTP/3 will gain traction and surpass the number of users with HTTP/2. Currently, over 80% of websites use HTTP/2; companies like Meta and Google have already adopted HTTP/3 and suggests that HTTP implementation cycles are becoming quicker, due to higher demands for web performance. </p>
