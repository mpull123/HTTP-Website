            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This website was created for the IT 3203 Web Development I course project. The objective of the project was to research a web technology topic and present the findings in a simple, multi-page informational website built from scratch. The site was constructed using HTML for content structure and a single external CSS file for all styling, including a layout built with CSS Flexbox. The research topic for this site is the history, development, and future of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
