            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Request-Response Model</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Defines how clients and servers interact with each other. When the client (or user) performs an action, the web browser sends a request for the desired resource. When the request is received and processed by the server, the server sends the requested resource to the client, along with a status code representing the outcome of the request from the client.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>Persistent Connections (Keep-Alive)</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Allowed a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to be utilized for many HTTP requests and responses at once. This reduced the number of resources necessary to load elements, leading to quicker data processing and webpage loading speeds.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>Multiplexing</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Eliminated the need for “head-of-line” blocking or the delay of other web elements from loading if an element in the sequence is not loaded or relayed properly.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>Server Push</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Enhanced loading speeds by immediately pushing all associated files for an HTML page. Instead of loading HTML files first and then CSS and JavaScript files sequentially, all associated files load together, increasing page rendering speed.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection)</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    A transport protocol that utilized User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP provides a better environment for real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP), online gaming, and streaming media, solving issues with mobile usage and high latency.
                </dd>
                
                <dt><strong>SSL/TLS Encryption</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is used by HTTPS so that data remains secure in the communication channel of the client and the server. This validates the legitimacy of a website, providing the user with data assurance.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>Header Compression (HPACK)</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    An enhancement for HTTP/2 that reduces the size of metadata sent with requests. This was created to eliminate uncompressed metadata that caused delays, significantly reducing the time needed to transfer data.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>Stream Prioritization</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    A feature in HTTP/2 that allows the browser to prioritize loading the most important webpage elements first (like text and images) before less important elements, heightening the user's perception of page loading speeds.
